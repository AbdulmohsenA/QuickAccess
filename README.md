## Outcomes
```
By doing this project. I learned a lot about JS/HTML Binding, Chrome extension bundles, JS language.
But the most important suggestion that i would give my future self is to NEVER use original CSS.
It is very troublesome and time consuming to achieve some basic UI requirements. A better alternative surely is there.

Hopefully i will make the next projects of this kind in React.js or any good alternative, because Vanilla JS/CSS is hard to handle.
