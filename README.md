## TODO
#### Functionality
- ~~**Add**: Add a button to add current site in the list.~~
- ~~**Delete**: Add a way to delete a site from the list.~~
- ~~**Clear**: clear the whole list.~~
- **Within**: Add a way (using badges) to search within a site that is already in the list

### UX
- ~~**Logos**: 32x32 logos are too small and blurry, find a way to represent a site better.~~
- **Not found**: if favicons are not found, make a good makeshift logo

#### Adjustments
- **Cleanup**: Optimize the code
- **UI/UX**: Enhance UI design
- **Security**: obfuscate the js code

## Outcomes
```
By doing this project. I learned a lot about JS/HTML Binding, Chrome extension bundles, JS language.
But the most important suggestion that i would give my future self is to NEVER use original CSS.
It is very tedious and time consuming to achieve some basic UI requirements. A better alternative surely is there.

Hopefully i will make the next projects of this kind in React.js or any good alternative, because Vanilla JS/CSS is hard to handle.
