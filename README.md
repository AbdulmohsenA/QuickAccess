## Outcomes
`By doing this project. I learned a lot about JS/HTML Binding, Chrome extension bundles, JS language. But the most important suggestion that i would give my future self is to NEVER use original CSS. 

Hopefully i will make the next projects of this kind in React.js or any good alternative, because Vanilla JS/CSS is hard to handle.
